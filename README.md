A Banking Web Application built using C# ASP.net. 

Teammates:

<li>Kowsar Rahman </li>
<li>Jay Verma </li><br><br>

<strong>Banking Web App -</strong>

It has features implemented upto Bill Paying. Users can do all the ATM functions and update their profile and view their statements too. Used extensively Week 6 code of Matthew. 

<strong>Admin Web Api -</strong> 

It has all the endpoints. Unfortunately the front end was not implemented. Runs on localhost 5000 port and made using the repository pattern.

Thanks,

Kowsar and Jay
